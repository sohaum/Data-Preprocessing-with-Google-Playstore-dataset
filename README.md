# Data Preprocessing with Google Playstore Dataset

This repository contains a Jupyter notebook for data preprocessing using the Google Playstore dataset. The notebook demonstrates various techniques to clean, transform, and prepare the dataset for further analysis or modeling.

## Overview

Data preprocessing is a fundamental step in any data science project. This notebook covers the preprocessing steps necessary to handle common issues found in real-world datasets, such as missing values, inconsistent data formats, and outliers.

## Features

- **Data Cleaning**: Handling missing values, correcting data types, and fixing inconsistencies.
- **Data Transformation**: Encoding categorical variables, scaling numerical features, and creating new features.
- **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**: Basic statistical analysis and visualizations to understand the data distribution and relationships.
- **Handling Outliers**: Techniques to identify and treat outliers in the dataset.
